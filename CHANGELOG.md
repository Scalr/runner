# Changelog

## Unreleased

## Added

Set `ENV PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1` within the Dockerfile to enable system-wide Python package installations by default, bypassing the externally-managed-environment error (PEP 668). This removes the need to explicitly use --break-system-packages or initialize a virtual environment for global pip installs during the image build process.

## Updated

Kubectl: from v1.33.0 to v1.33.1
Google Cloud CLI (gcloud): from 519.0.0 to 525.0.0
AWS CLI: from 2.27.1 to 2.27.32
Azure CLI: from 2.71.0 to 2.74.0
Scalr CLI: from 0.17.0 to 0.17.1
